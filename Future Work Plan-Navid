## Future Work Plan

### Remaining Tasks:
1. **Spatial Join**: Perform a spatial join between the **litter** data and the **blighted areas** to determine the proximity between the two.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform a **correlation analysis** to understand the relationship between litter density and proximity to blighted areas.
3. **Visualization**: Create additional visualizations such as heatmaps or density plots to better visualize areas with high litter density.
4. **Final Report**: Summarize the findings in a report, including maps, statistical analysis, and interpretations of the data.

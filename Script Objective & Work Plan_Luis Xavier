The objective of the code is to develop a code that shows some of the relevant characteristics of an aquifer (water altitude raster, vadose zone thickness, isopach map, etc.) by having as inputs a point layer with the water depth from the surface and a digital elevation model. The output layers are intended to generate a quick visualization of the aquifer conditions, however, a more in-depth analysis will have to be performed because the code performs an interpolation which is linked to an error percentage.
